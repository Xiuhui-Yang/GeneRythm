# Getting Started
## 1. Introduction
scGeneRhythm is an innovative tool designed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. It utilizes deep learning techniques and Fourier transformation to examine gene expression data, aiming to reveal gene relationships and provide valuable biological insights.


### Key Features and Functions

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** GeneRhythm conducts simultaneous analyses in both the time and frequency domains, offering a more holistic perspective.

- **Uncovering Hidden Relationships:** This tool helps identify genes that may appear distinct in the time domain but exhibit similarities in the frequency domain.

- **Outstanding Performance:** scGeneRhythm has demonstrated exceptional performance in gene clustering and pathway enrichment analysis across various single-cell datasets.

- **In-Depth Gene Rhythmicity:** scGeneRhythm assists in uncovering gene rhythmicity and hidden associations, contributing to advancements in cellular and molecular biology research.

### Setting Up R Environment

R is a powerful programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. This guide will walk you through the process of downloading and setting up an R environment on your system.

### Step 1: Download R

1. Visit the official R Project website at [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).

2. Click on the "Download R" link located at the top of the page.

3. Choose a CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) mirror site near your location. Select the mirror site that is most appropriate for your region.

4. Download the R distribution for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your specific platform.

### Step 2: Install R

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

- **macOS**: Double-click the downloaded package file and follow the installation prompts.

- **Linux**: Install R using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install r-base
   ```

### Step 3: Download an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Optional)

While R can be used from the command line, you may find it helpful to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to enhance your productivity. Two popular options are:

- **RStudio**: Download RStudio from [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/). It provides a user-friendly interface and many useful features for R programming.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Install the "R Language" extension in VS Code to enable R programming support.

### Step 4: Start Using R

You are now ready to start using R! You can launch R by typing `R` in your command prompt or terminal. Alternatively, if you installed an IDE like RStudio or set up R in VS Code, you can start R from there.

### Step 5: Install R Packages (Optional)

R has a vast ecosystem of packages for various data analysis and visualization tasks. You can install packages using the `install.packages("package_name")` command in the R console. For example, to install the "ggplot2" package, you would run:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Configuring Python Environment with Conda

Conda is a package and environment management system that makes it easy to create and manage isolated Python environments. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring a Python environment using Conda.

### Step 1: Install Conda

1. If you haven't already installed Conda, start by downloading the Anaconda distribution or Miniconda, a minimal Conda installer.

   - **Anaconda**: Visit the Anaconda website at [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the Anaconda distribution suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

   - **Miniconda**: Alternatively, you can download Miniconda from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Miniconda provides a more lightweight installation.

2. Follow the installation instructions provided on the Anaconda or Miniconda website for your specific operating system.

### Step 2: Create a Conda Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new Conda environment with a specific Python version. Replace `myenv` with your chosen environment name and `X.Y` with the desired Python version (e.g., 3.7, 3.8, 3.9):

   ```
   conda create --name myenv python=X.Y
   ```

3. Activate the newly created environment:

   - **On Windows:**

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

   ```
   source activate myenv
   ```

### Step 3: Install Python Packages

1. With the Conda environment activated, you can install Python packages into the isolated environment. For example, to install the `numpy` package, run:

   ```
   conda install numpy
   ```

   You can install any packages you need for your project in a similar manner.

### Step 4: Deactivate the Environment

When you're done working in the Conda environment, you can deactivate it to return to your system's default Python environment:

- **On Windows:**

   ```
   conda deactivate
   ```

- **On macOS and Linux:**

   ```
   source deactivate
   ```


### Step 5: Using the Conda Environment

Remember to activate your Conda environment whenever you work on your project. This isolates your project from system-wide Python installations and ensures consistency in package versions.

### Additional Resources

- For more details on Conda, you can refer to the official documentation at [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).

Now you have a configured Python environment using Conda, and you can start working on your Python projects with isolation and ease of package management.
